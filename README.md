Not an effective chess engine but just a brainstorming/Proof of concept project for understanding how neural network can learn and play chess.

Project started after reading this article:
https://www.futura-sciences.com/tech/actualites/technologie-alphazero-ia-google-deepmind-devient-imbattable-echecs-61409/
which make interrogate ourself on how well NN can understand well chess strategies.

See credits.md for code source inspirations.
See INSTALL for compilation and how to call options.

Project features:
* Chessboard GUI and basic interactions with the user.
* Chess engine: chess rules implemented, basic eval functions and no alpha/beta implementation.
* Communication with Stockfish or tcsp.
* (in gestation) neural implementation.
