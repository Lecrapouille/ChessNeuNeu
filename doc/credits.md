# Bibliography and code source inspirations.

The code source of this project gets its inspiration from different books, ethernet documents and code sources of opensource chess engines.

## Books

* `(french) Programmation efficace: Echecs et C` by _Yann Takvorian, Editions Radio, 1991._

This book explains C structures and routines needed for implementing a chess engine. This is a very complete book and is an absolute need
for your booksheld. The code style is old and does not use modern programming patterns !

* `How Computers Play Chess` by _David N. L. Levy, Batsford Chess Edition, 1983._

Interesting book but it's more based on chess philosophy than pure coding book (no code, no implementation).
Algorithms described with the help of chess diagrams and grand masters games.

## Chess projects

Some code source of this project got its inspiration from other chess projects:

* Legal moves is mainly inspired by:
  - http://www.tckerrigan.com/Chess/TSCP/
  - http://home.hccnet.nl/h.g.muller/max-src2.html
  - https://github.com/thomasahle/sunfish

* GUI made in SFML was based on Youtube tutorial: [Let's make 16 games in C++](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4EuZI8Q8cs)

* GUI state machine: [this tutorial](https://github.com/eXpl0it3r/SmallGameEngine)
and this [library](https://www.binpress.com/tutorial/creating-a-city-building-game-with-sfml/137)

## IA

With did not use external libraries or get inspiration from other code source. Anyway, here some nice tutorials:

* Convolutional Neural Networks learn chess moves:

* Mastering Chess and Shogi by Self-Play with a General Reinforcement Learning Algorithm:

* Neural network (C++):

## Curiosity
