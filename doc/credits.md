The project code source get its inspiration from books:

* (french) Programmation efficace: Echecs et C
by Yann Takvorian, Editions Radio, 1991.

Explain C structures and routines needed for implementing a chess engine. Very complete book. An absolute need !

* How Computers Play Chess
by David N. L. Levy, Batsford Chess Edition, 1983.

Interesting book but more based on chess philosophy than code book. Algorithms are just described with no implementation.

The project code source get its inspiration from other projects:

* Legal moves:

* GUI made in SFML: Youtube Let's make 16 games in C++

This project is connected with the Chess engines:

IA is inspired by papers and code source:

* Mastering Chess and Shogi by Self-Play with a General Reinforcement Learning Algorithm
